# OmniStack 10.0 by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br)

During the week we'll able to develop a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) back end, [React JS](https://pt-br.reactjs.org/) front end and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) mobile application. In general, the purpose of this app is search for developers near from your current location. To do it the React JS uses the geolocation system provided by the browser and the React Native Application uses the Location from Expo API. This application is simple but rich of concepts that concern React world like Components, State and Props. Besides that we explored the Expo API using the WebView, Location and MapView to create the mobile application.
